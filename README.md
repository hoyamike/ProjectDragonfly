# Project Dragonfly

The Project Dragonfly Investigative App is an iOS application used by children to conduct basic scientific experiments. The users  use various tools to collect data. These collections of data are organized into investigations which are further organized into investigation categories. Each investigation can can use a single "type" of tool (currently a counter, stopwatch, and timed counter). Data within an investigation can be visualized into charts. Investigations can be shared via email, text, twitter, etc. This project was written in Swift 3 and Developed in XCode 8.0.
